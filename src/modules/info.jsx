      <h3>My Professional Background:&#32;</h3>
      <p>I spent the first 8 years of my career developing a joy for working
        with people of diverse backgrounds - I was a high school French teacher.
        Through this experience I also continued to develop a love I&#39;ve had my whole life of
        solving puzzles and complex problems. I should have been a math teacher.
        When the time came for me to transition into a new career, it was clear that
        I needed something that would challenge me and continue to allow me to work with
        all manner of people and solve all manner of problems. Coding has allowed me to work
        with people from all around the globe without leaving my desk. I find joy solving coding
        challenges -  I even like hunting bugs. I have worked hard to become an effective pair
        programming partner. I participate fully in retrospectives. I can work on agile teams
        and ensure everyone&#39;s voice is included in the discussion.
